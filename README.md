## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd micro-insurance-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following configuration:

```bash
PROJECT_NAME=MicroInsuranceSystem
VITE_APP_NETWORK=testnet
VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS=0x2abb1ab290cb828323bf6da71a3f36011d59cd7aa576474f19dbcae50521e056
```

Replace `<VITE_MODULE_ADDRESS>` with the address where your smart contract is deployed.

### 4. Run the Development Server

To start the project in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### 5. Deploy the Smart Contract

To deploy the smart contract:

1.  Install **Aptos CLI**.
2.  Update the **Move.toml** file with your wallet address:

    - Add you Wallet Address from Petra here

    ```bash
    sys_addrx = "0xca10b0176c34f9a8315589ff977645e04497814e9753d21f7d7e7c3d83aa7b57"
    ```

    - Add your Account addr here for Deployment

    ```bash
    my_addrx = "2abb1ab290cb828323bf6da71a3f36011d59cd7aa576474f19dbcae50521e056"
    ```

3.  Create your new Address for Deployment

    ```bash
    aptos init
    ```

4.  Compile and publish the contract:

    ```bash
    aptos move compile
    aptos move publish
    ```

## üõ† How to Use the Platform

### 1. Connect Wallet

When the application opens, connect your Aptos wallet (e.g., Petra Wallet) to interact with the platform. This allows you to buy policies, submit claims, and receive payouts seamlessly.

### 2. Browse Insurance Policies

Navigate to the **Policies** section to view available policies. Each policy lists the following details:

- Policy description
- Premium amount
- Maximum claimable amount
- Payment type (one-time or yearly)
- Policy creator information

### 3. Purchase Policy

To buy a policy:

- Select the desired policy.
- The platform will prompt you to pay the premium in **APT** through your connected wallet.
- After purchase, the policy will be listed under **My Policies**.

### 4. Request Insurance Claim

To file a claim:

- Go to the **My Policies** section and choose the policy.
- Click on **Request Claim** to initiate the claim request.
- The claim will be sent to the policy creator for verification.

### 5. Claim Verification and Payout

For policy creators:

- Navigate to the **Manage Policies** section to review incoming claims.
- Select the relevant policy and verify the claim.
- Once verified, the payout will be automatically transferred to the customer‚Äôs wallet using the predefined claim amount.

## üöÄ Scaling and Deployment

If deploying on **Vercel** or similar platforms:

- Use **third-party RPC providers** such as **Alchemy** or **QuickNode**.
- Implement **request throttling** to handle high traffic efficiently.
- Use **WebSockets** for real-time updates to improve user experience.
